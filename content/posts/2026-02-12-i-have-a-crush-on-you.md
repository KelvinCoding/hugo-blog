*I have a crush on you.*
But not in the modern, digital way,
Not where I scroll through photos to track what you say.

*I have a crush on you.*
In the way I get a spark when I hear your key in the door,
A rush of excitement I didn't think happened anymore.

*I have a crush on you.*
But not in a way that is controlling or tight,
Not just to keep you within my sight.

*I have a crush on you.*
In the way I’d pick you for a fancy night out, or a nap at two,
In the way that I simply love doing nothing with you.

*I have a crush on you.*
But not in a search for some fleeting glory,
Or a fictional, made-for-TV story.

*I have a crush on you.*
In the way I love your side-eye and the jokes you make,
In the way I’d offer you the very last slice of cake.

*I have a crush on you.*
In the way I feel safe to be weird by your side,
Where your warmth and mine leave us nothing to hide.

*I have a crush on you.*
In the way I want to learn, and grow, and be better,
Because the best version of me is when we are together.

*I have a crush on you.*
In the way that my love is deep, and steady, and true,
I get to spend my whole life having a crush on you.
