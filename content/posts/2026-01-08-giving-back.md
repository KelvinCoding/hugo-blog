I went into January thinking I could architect the year. I sat down to do my "8760," mapping out exactly what I would do for every single hour of the next twelve months. I wanted to turn time into a resource I could control. I wanted to quantify my life with cold, grid-like precision.

But I couldn't do it. The grid remained empty.

## The Reunion

The week started with a reunion. I met up with my old team, and we sat there, a decade and a half of history sitting heavy at the table. I felt a sharp pang of nostalgia—looking at faces that belonged to a different version of myself. Everyone is in a different place now. New lives brought into the world, some lives lost along the way. I wasn’t asking if they were "happy." I was just aware that they were there.

We were living together in that specific, fleeting moment. But I felt like a ghost haunting my own history.

Then the days blurred into static.

I don't remember the daylight hours. I was operating on autopilot, a machine moving through the mechanics of the week without actually occupying the space. The only time I felt real was in the evenings. The late-night breeze, the storms, the clear skies.

In those walks, the doubts didn't just whisper; they argued. One part of my mind insisted I wasn't doing enough. Another part insisted I was. I looked for a path, but the ground felt unsure.

The week continued in that haze. But emotions don't stay bottled forever; they compress. I felt the pressure building; saddened, afraid, trapped. Exhausted.

**And then, I broke.**

I found myself drowning in songs, letting them wash over me until one latched onto the jagged edge of my mood.

> I miss being understood.

I missed that specific frequency I felt with my old friends. The stories that never end. The nights that turn into mornings. The feeling of belonging not as an achievement to unlock, but as a place to simply be.

I started seeking that connection again. Not out of desperation, but out of necessity. My body knew what it needed before I did.

## A Correction

**And then, the static cracked.**

It wasn't a grand revelation. It was just a stray lyric from the background noise. It didn't feel like a discovery; it felt like a mechanical correction.

The song was listing all the places connection lives. Seen in parks, read in books, dancing with friends around a table. It described exactly how I had been feeling: an observer watching love happen to everyone else through a pane of glass.

But then the logic flipped.

I had been looking at connection as a prize I was failing to win, a transaction where I traded success for belonging. But the lyric forced me to acknowledge the deficit in my own chest. I am *"able to give it back the way it gives to me."*

Suddenly, the isolation didn't feel so absolute. It wasn't that I was empty; it was just that I was waiting to pour back out. Connection wasn't just something I watched from a distance; it was something I had been withholding.

That is where I land for the week. It doesn't feel like a victory lap. The longing is still there, heavy and present. But I remember now that connection is mine to give, not just to take.

I haven't solved the year. I haven't filled in my 8760. But I have the ability to survive the hours.
