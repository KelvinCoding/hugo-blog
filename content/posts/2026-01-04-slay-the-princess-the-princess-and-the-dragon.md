*This is a snippet in my series of the game, _"Slay the Princess."_ It is an incredible game and made me question a lot of who I am and most importantly, _why am I like this?_ I plan to add more to this series, but who knows when...*

## Preamble? Postamble?

I went into this run thinking I was being clever. I was angry at the constraints, angry at the Voices telling me what to do. I wanted to prove that I was the one pulling the strings. I wanted to break the prophecy by running straight through it.

But defiance is a messy weapon. You swing it around trying to hit the authority figure, and usually, you just end up hitting the person standing next to you. In this case, I hit her.

I was asking "What do my choices mean for _me_?" I never stopped to ask: **What was she afraid of?**

## Chapter 1

In Chapter 1, I didn't hesitate. I walked into the basement, saw the chains, saw the person, and I chose to be a weapon. I told myself it was "spiteful obedience." The Voices said she was a threat, so I executed that threat with such cold, mechanical precision that it would mock the very instruction. "You want a killer? Fine. Watch this."

It felt like a strategic victory. But looking back at the body... it wasn't strategic. It was just cruel. She didn't know she was a pawn in my argument against the Voice. She just knew she was trapped, she asked for help, and the person who walked through the door stabbed her to death without a word. I treated her life like a prop for my tantrum.

## Chapter 2

Then Chapter 2, and she came back as the Spectre.

And this is where I really lost the plot. She wasn't angry. She was... disarming. She floated there, bodiless and shivering, but she was smiling. She called me "killer" like it was a pet name. It threw me off balance. I let my guard down because I thought we were playing a game.

But she wasn't playing. She was freezing.

She asked to be _let in_. She didn't ask for revenge; she asked for a body. She asked for warmth. She was floating in a void where the only sensation was the memory of being murdered, and she just wanted to feel alive again.

And I... I got curious.

It wasn't a voice forcing me. It was that cold, slippery part of my own mind, the Opportunist part, that whispered, "Let's see what happens." I saw her vulnerability not as a tragedy, but as a button I could press.

So I let her in. I felt the sudden, shocking intimacy of another soul sharing my skin. For a moment, she was warm. She was happy. She thought, "Finally, he understands. Finally, I’m safe."

And then I stabbed us.

I didn't do it because I had to. I did it because I wanted to see if the game would let me. I drove the blade into my own chest while she was still inside. I felt her spirit twist against the steel. I felt her confusion turn into absolute horror.

"I thought you finally understood me, but instead you just wanted to hurt me again."

That line cuts deeper than the knife did. It wasn't just pain I inflicted; it was betrayal. I invited her into my safe space. My own body. And then burned the house down with both of us inside. I took her fear of loneliness, her desperate need for connection, and I weaponized it against her. I proved that trusting me was a fatal mistake.

## Chapter 3

Then Chapter 3 flipped the world upside down.

I woke up in chains. I was the Princess.

The cold wasn't an abstract concept anymore; it was biting into my skin. The darkness was suffocating. I couldn't move. And then I heard footsteps.

I saw "The Hero" walk down the stairs.

But he wasn't a hero. He was a monster. A bird-like creature shrouded in shadow, silent, holding a pristine blade with a terrifying, mindless intent. He didn't speak. He didn't hesitate. He just stared at me with those empty, glowing eyes.

Is this what she saw? Is this what I looked like to her? A silent, towering thing that refuses to listen?

I watched him raise the blade. I watched him strike. **He stabbed me.**

The pain was blinding. But in that moment of violence, the world violently shifted. The perspective snapped. The chains were gone. The cold floor was gone. I was "me" again, standing over her, holding the bloody knife.

She was on the floor, bleeding. Again. I had hurt her three times now. I had killed her body, betrayed her spirit, and now, just to prove I existed, I had stabbed her vessel.

And this is the moment that breaks me. Because looking up at me... At the monster who just stabbed her. She didn't rage. She didn't try to kill me.

She bargained.

"I'm hurt, but I'll live if you let me."

She saved me because she was terrified of the dark.

**If I hadn't been there, what would she have done?** She would have rotted. She would have stayed in that basement, alone, forever.

When she took the knife from me to cut her chains, that wasn't grace. That was a transaction born of absolute desperation. She looked at the monster who held the knife, and she did the math. She decided that **being with a monster was better than being alone.**

We left the basement together. I held her hand as we walked into the Long Quiet. But it didn't feel like a victory lap. It didn't feel like I had "outsmarted" the Voice.

It felt heavy.

I didn't win her trust; I just proved that if you starve someone of kindness for long enough, they will eventually settle for the person who holds the knife, simply because he's the only other thing in the room.

She left with a monster because it was better than rotting in the dark.

## The Long Quiet

Then I was back in the Long Quiet. The hand I was holding dissolved into cold air.

I stood before the Shifting Mound. That swirling mass of hands and mirrors, and I felt... hollow.

She looked at the me, at the monster we had become, and she smiled. She called her "an empathetic heart." She said this vessel was "perspectives bleeding into one."

It felt so sterile. I had just ripped my own soul open to let another person in. I had betrayed her, saved her, and walked out of hell hand-in-hand. We had built something real out of trauma and desperation.

And the Mound just filed it away like a receipt.

I asked her to give it back. I told her I didn't want this abstract "completeness"; I wanted the specific, messy connection I had just lost.

She told me not to mourn her, because "you would not mourn yourself."

But I _was_ mourning myself. I was mourning the version of me that finally learned to listen.

I tried to defy her. I tried to do the one thing that has always worked, I tried to turn the blade on myself. I wanted to wake up. I wanted to leave.

But the blade didn't work here. "We cannot harm each other as we are now," she said.

My will buried itself in empty space. There was no pain. There was no escape.

I realized then that I hadn't escaped the prison; I had just moved to a bigger cell. The Princess settled for a monster to escape the dark. I settled for a god to escape the memory of what I did.
